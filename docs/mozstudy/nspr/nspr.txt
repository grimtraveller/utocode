NSPR API Reference
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en/NSPR_API_Reference
thread implement
 implement in different os types, there are three types in nspr.
 pt type(POSIX), bt type(BeOS), user type(win32, etc)
 in (linux)posix, implement source file is named by pr/src/pthreads/ptxxx.c
 in win32, implement source file is named by pr/src/pruxxx.c
in 
 Thread Models
    * user thread model(win32)      - not pthreads or BeOS threads
    * posix thread model(pthread)   - POSIX pthread
    * beos thread model(bthread)    - igorne
 Thread Scope
    * local threads
      are handled entirely by NSPR, 
      in OS that doesn't support threads, 
      or to emulate a relatively large number of local threads by using a relatively small number of native threads
    * global threads
      are scheduled by the OS. Global threads correspond the native threads on OS.
 Thread type
    * PR_USER_THREAD
        PR_CLeanup() blocks until the last thread of type PR_USER_THREAD terminates.
    * PR_SYSTEM_THREAD
        NSPR ignores threads of type PR_SYSTEM_THREAD 
        when determining when a call to PR_Cleanup() should return.
win32 thread implement
    * two thread scopes, local and global.
    * undefined _PR_PTHREAD
    * define HAVE_CUSTOM_USER_THREADS in "_winnt.h"
    



Thread Macro
    * _PR_PTHREAD
        in "/configure.in" `set USE_PTHREADS=1` by host OS(linux define USE_PTHREADS, win32 undefine USE_PTHREADS).
        in "config/config.mk" if define USE_PTHREADS then `-D_PR_PTHREADS`
        "makefile.in" call "rule.mk" call "config.mk" set `#define _PR_PTHREADS`
    * PT_NO_SIGTIMEDWAIT
        in "pr/include/private/primpl.h" `#include "md/prosdep.h"`
        in "pr/include/md/prosdep.h" `#include "md/_pth.h"`
        in "pr/include/md/_pth.h" `#ifdef _PR_THREADS #define PT_NO_SIGTIMEDWAIT`
    * _PR_POLL_WITH_SELECT
        hpux,osf
    * declartion `struct MDThread`

*volatile 
 A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value could change unexpectedly. In practice, only three types of variables could change:
  1. Memory-mapped peripheral registers
  2. Global variables modified by an interrupt service routine
  3. Global variables accessed by multiple tasks within a multi-threaded application
