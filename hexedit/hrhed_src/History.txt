version 1.0.155 beta 3: March 21st, 2000
- Replace can also delete found data now ("replace with empty").
  Problem: the first occurance is NOT replaced.
- Uses pabs's MessageCopyBox in file properties and read-float command.
- Give a warning if character keys are pressed in read-only mode.
- Added pabs's copy button in the comparison results window.

version 1.0.155 beta 2: March 9th, 2000
- Modified View Options dialogue by placing the "automatically adjust bytes per line"
  checkbox nearer to the edit box for bytes per line and added some clarifying text.
- Modified fill_with with Pabs' patch because it would crash when compiled
  with MS VC++ 4.0.
- Added a "dummy = 0;" in SimpleArray<T>::Replace because there used to be a warning
  about uninitialized data.
- Deselected data after loading a new file.
- View status is updated after using "Insert file" command, used to cause trouble
  with scrolling.
- Can't choose file being edited for "Insert file".

version 1.0.155 beta 1
- Added Replace command.
- Added rest of Pabs' improvements.
- Added Pabs' bit display to status window.
- Fixed bug in cut command: "Cut up to and including offset" would show value
  too large by one.
- When dragging the vertical scrollbar button to the bottom the data displayed
  does not consist of only the last line at the top of the window anymore.
- Now two separator lines in front of the characters.
- Automatically make selected data the data to search for for the find command. Also works
  with the find-next and find-previous commands. (Problem: find-previous finds the actual previous
  occurance only after *two* calls)
- In the save-as command: asks if a file should be overwritten if it already existed.
- Fixed Cut bug: using "cut up to offset" would always return 1 byte to cut.
- Fixed bug in find function: searching would find values at end
  of file position.
- Improved procedure for inserting of hex values with keyboard.
- Added typecasts in filedrop-handler for compatibility with newer VC compilers.
- Fixed open from command line problem in Win2000 (patch sent in by Bo Wannerberg).
- Changed some menu captions in Edit menu.
- Cursor changes to text i-beam when selecting.
- Added command to add frhed to the Windows Explorer context menu.

Following notes were copied from Pabs' history file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
31st January 2000:version 1.0.155 - pabs patch
- The fill selection with command allows you to |=, &= or ^= the current byte of
  your expression with that of the file

25th-27th January 2000:version 1.0.155 - pabs patch
- Added save selection as, insert file, delete file & close file (same as new in fact IS new(same id therefore is the same))
- can specify the number of bytes to skip between pastes

20th&21st January 2000:version 1.0.155 - pabs patch
- fill with dlg box displays hex versions of sizes and only uses 
  the symbol font for the infinity character-not for nums as well
- odd numbers of hex digits entered result in the buf being a char
  version of concatenation of two of the hex versions
  not the last byte being 0X where X is the last (odd numbered) hex digit
  eg "ffa"->"ffaffa"->"ÿ¯ú"
      odd    even      char
- the char box was pissing me off so I got rid of it
- status bar also shows the bits of the current byte in order MSB to LSB
- can now revert to saved version of file

21st January 1999: version 1.0.145

  filename first, then "frhed" (easier to tell what file open
  when several instances of program are open).

  are line breaks.
